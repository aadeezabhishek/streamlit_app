There are people who come into your life, sometimes, to be there for a seaon.
They weren't meant to be there always.
Sometimes we find ourselves hooked up with people that we think are there for a lifetime;
But they were only suppose to be there for a season.
There are people who come in your life like boosters for a rocket.
If you ever watch a rocket go into space the boosters fall off, when it reaches certain altitude.
Some people are not equipped to handle the altitude you're going to.
So don't be afraid when they fall off, they're not bad people.
They just couldn't go where you're going.

You're suffering from self-doubt; while others are intimidated by your full potential.
